# ChromaDB Pipeline Directory Structure

The chromadb_pipeline.py file uses a simpler directory structure compared to the Pinecone implementation since ChromaDB is a local vector database. Here's a breakdown of the directories and files:

## 1. Main Data Directory

**chroma_db**: Primary storage location for ChromaDB
   - Located at project root level (defined by `CHROMA_DB_PATH`)
   - Created automatically when the database is first used
   - Contains all vector database files, indexes, and metadata

## 2. Collection Structure (Inside chroma_db/)

ChromaDB organizes data into collections. By default, this code uses:
- `chromadb_embeddings/`: Default collection (from `COLLECTION_NAME` constant)
- `nvidia_embeddings/`: Alternative collection for Nvidia-specific data

Each collection directory contains:
- `chroma.sqlite3`: SQLite database storing metadata and references
- `embeddings/`: Contains the actual vector embeddings
- `index/`: HNSW index files for similarity search
- `metadata/`: Additional metadata about the documents

## 3. Model Cache Directories

The code uses SentenceTransformer models which are cached locally:
- `~/.cache/torch/sentence_transformers/`: Default cache for embedding models
  - Contains the downloaded model files (e.g., `all-MiniLM-L6-v2/`)

## 4. NLTK Data

The code uses NLTK for tokenization:
- `~/nltk_data/`: Default NLTK data directory
  - `tokenizers/punkt/`: Tokenizer data downloaded by the code

## 5. Test Input Files

Unlike the more complex Pinecone pipeline, the ChromaDB pipeline primarily works with:
- **Input Markdown files**: Provided via command line arguments
- No specific directory structure is required for input files
- Can process files with naming patterns like `Q1_2020.md` to extract metadata

## Key Differences from Pinecone

The ChromaDB implementation is significantly simpler in terms of file management because:

1. **Local Storage**: ChromaDB stores everything locally rather than in a cloud service
2. **Self-Contained**: ChromaDB manages its own directory structure internally
3. **No Need for JSON Chunk Storage**: Full chunk content is stored directly in ChromaDB
4. **Simpler Metadata**: Less complex metadata handling compared to Pinecone

When you run the ChromaDB pipeline, it automatically creates all necessary directories. You just need to provide an input markdown file, and it will handle the rest of the storage and indexing internally.

The main advantage is simplicity - you don't need to manage separate JSON files or complex directory structures as with the Pinecone implementation. However, this also means you're limited to local processing and may face scaling issues with very large document collections.
